    "-   Consider the following algorithm to generate a sequence of numbers. Start with an integer n. If n is even, divide by 2. If n is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1. Repeat this process with the new value of n, terminating when n = 1. For example, the following sequence of numbers will be generated for n = 22:\n",

    "    It is conjectured (but not yet proven) that this algorithm will terminate at n = 1 forevery integer n. Still, the conjecture holds for all integers up to at least 1, 000, 000.For an input n, the cycle-length of n is the number of numbers generated up to and including the 1. In the example above, the cycle length of 22 is 16. Given any two numbers i and j, you are to determine the maximum cycle length over all numbers between i and j, including both endpoints.\n",

    "-Have you ever played Minesweeper? This cute little game comes with a certain operating system whose name we can’t remember. The goal of the game is to find where all the mines are located within a M × N field.The game shows a number in a square which tells you how many mines there are adjacent to that square. Each square has at most eight adjacent squares. The 4×4 field on the left contains two mines, each represented by a “*” character. If we represent the same field by the hint numbers described above, we end up with the field on the right:\n",
